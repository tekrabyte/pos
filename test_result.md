# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##
## frontend:

##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.js"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"

##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"

##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

      ✅ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE - v2.0 Production-Ready

      **Backend Enhancements:**
      - ✅ Added WebSocket support for real-time order notifications
      - ✅ Fixed QR code URL generation to use FRONTEND_URL environment variable
      - ✅ Order creation now broadcasts WebSocket notification
      - ✅ Order status update broadcasts WebSocket notification
      - ✅ All 12 API endpoints implemented and ready

      **Frontend Pages Created:**
      - ✅ CustomerMenu.jsx - GoFood-style e-commerce menu
      - ✅ CustomerCart.jsx - Complete checkout with payment
      - ✅ CustomerOrders.jsx - Order history and tracking
      - ✅ CustomerProfile.jsx - Customer profile management
      - ✅ TableManagement.jsx - Admin QR code generator
      - ✅ OrderManagement.jsx - Kasir panel with WebSocket

      **Key Features:**
      1. Separated login system (Staff vs Customer)
      2. Customer mandatory registration
      3. Dine-in via QR scan (no login required)
      4. Takeaway requires customer login
      5. Real-time WebSocket notifications with badge counter
      6. QRIS & Bank Transfer payment with proof upload
      7. Order status workflow: pending → confirmed → cooking → ready → completed
      8. Production-ready QR codes with environment URL

      **Ready for Backend Testing:**
      All backend endpoints should be tested including:
      - Authentication flows
      - Table CRUD and QR generation
      - Order creation (both types)
      - Payment upload
      - WebSocket connection
      - Order status updates

      Frontend will need manual testing or UI testing agent after backend is verified.
