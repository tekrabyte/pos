# Test Results and Issue Tracking

## Original Problem Statement

The application was experiencing multiple React rendering errors and API endpoint issues:

1. **React rendering error**: "Objects are not valid as a React child (found: object with keys {String, Valid})"
2. **CustomerMenu products error**: `products.filter is not a function` 
3. **404 errors on `/api/coupons/available` endpoint**
4. **All API calls going to `/undefined/...` URLs**

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### Issue 1: Backend Route Ordering Problem
**Problem**: The route `/api/coupons/available` was defined AFTER `/api/coupons/:id`, causing the router to match "available" as an ID parameter.

**Fix Applied**: 
- Moved `/api/coupons/available` route definition BEFORE `/api/coupons/:id` in `/app/backend/routes.go`
- Removed duplicate route definition

**Files Modified**:
- `/app/backend/routes.go` (lines 76-81, removed lines 128-129)

### Issue 2: User Object SQL Null Fields Serialization
**Problem**: The `GetCurrentUser` handler was returning raw Go structs with `sql.NullString` types, which serialize to JSON as objects like `{String: "value", Valid: true}` instead of simple strings, causing React to fail when trying to render them.

**Fix Applied**:
- Updated `GetCurrentUser` handler to properly serialize null fields using helper functions
- Added `getNullBool` helper function for handling `sql.NullBool` types
- All user fields now properly serialized to JSON

**Files Modified**:
- `/app/backend/handlers.go` (added `getNullBool` function, updated `GetCurrentUser` function lines 192-231)

### Issue 3: Frontend Products Array Handling
**Problem**: The backend API returns `{success: true, products: [...]}`, but the frontend was setting `products` state to the entire response object instead of just the products array, causing `products.filter()` to fail.

**Fix Applied**:
- Updated `fetchProducts` to extract `response.data.products` instead of `response.data`
- Added fallback to empty array if products is undefined

**Files Modified**:
- `/app/frontend/src/pages/customer/CustomerMenu.jsx` (line 124)

### Issue 4: Missing REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL Environment Variable
**Problem**: The frontend had no `.env` file, causing `process.env.REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL` to be undefined, resulting in all API calls going to `/undefined/...`

**Fix Applied**:
- Created `/app/frontend/.env` file with proper backend URL
- Set `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=https://go-api-sync.preview.emergentagent.com/api`

**Files Created**:
- `/app/frontend/.env`

### Issue 5: Backend Server Not Running via Supervisor
**Problem**: Supervisor was configured for Python/uvicorn but the actual backend is Go-based.

**Temporary Fix Applied**:
- Started Go backend server manually: `cd /app/backend && ./server &`
- Server running on port 8001 and responding to health checks

## Current Status

✅ **Backend**: Running successfully on port 8001
- Health check endpoint responding: `http://localhost:8001/api/health`
- All routes properly configured
- SQL null fields properly serialized

✅ **Frontend**: Restarted to pick up new environment variables
- Environment variable properly set
- Products API call fixed to handle response structure
- Should now make API calls to correct URL

⚠️ **Known Issue**: Backend is running manually instead of via supervisor (supervisor is configured for Python/uvicorn instead of Go)

## Testing Protocol

### Backend Testing
Before making any backend changes, always test:
1. Health endpoint: `curl http://localhost:8001/api/health`
2. Coupons available endpoint: `curl http://localhost:8001/api/coupons/available`
3. Products endpoint: `curl http://localhost:8001/api/products`

### Frontend Testing
After frontend changes:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify API calls are going to correct URL (should include `/api` prefix)
3. Verify data is properly displayed in UI

### Incorporate User Feedback
- Always read user's error logs carefully
- Check for `/undefined/...` URLs which indicate missing environment variables
- Look for React object rendering errors which might indicate SQL null types being improperly serialized
- Verify route ordering when specific routes return 404 but handler exists

## Next Steps

The application should now:
1. ✅ Load products correctly in CustomerMenu
2. ✅ Display user information correctly in Layout
3. ✅ Access coupons/available endpoint successfully
4. ✅ Make all API calls to proper backend URL

Please test the application and report any remaining issues.
