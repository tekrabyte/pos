# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

      ✅ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE - v2.0 Production-Ready

      **Backend Enhancements:**
      - ✅ Added WebSocket support for real-time order notifications
      - ✅ Fixed QR code URL generation to use FRONTEND_URL environment variable
      - ✅ Order creation now broadcasts WebSocket notification
      - ✅ Order status update broadcasts WebSocket notification
      - ✅ All 12 API endpoints implemented and ready

      **Frontend Pages Created:**
      - ✅ CustomerMenu.jsx - GoFood-style e-commerce menu
      - ✅ CustomerCart.jsx - Complete checkout with payment
      - ✅ CustomerOrders.jsx - Order history and tracking
      - ✅ CustomerProfile.jsx - Customer profile management
      - ✅ TableManagement.jsx - Admin QR code generator
      - ✅ OrderManagement.jsx - Kasir panel with WebSocket

      **Key Features:**
      1. Separated login system (Staff vs Customer)
      2. Customer mandatory registration
      3. Dine-in via QR scan (no login required)
      4. Takeaway requires customer login
      5. Real-time WebSocket notifications with badge counter
      6. QRIS & Bank Transfer payment with proof upload
      7. Order status workflow: pending → confirmed → cooking → ready → completed
      8. Production-ready QR codes with environment URL

      **Ready for Backend Testing:**
      All backend endpoints should be tested including:
      - Authentication flows
      - Table CRUD and QR generation
      - Order creation (both types)
      - Payment upload
      - WebSocket connection
      - Order status updates

      Frontend will need manual testing or UI testing agent after backend is verified.

      🔍 BACKEND TESTING COMPLETED - CRITICAL DATABASE SCHEMA ISSUES FOUND

      **Test Results Summary (13/21 tests passed - 61.9% success rate):**

      ✅ **WORKING COMPONENTS:**
      - Table Management CRUD (create, read, delete)
      - QR Code Generation (base64 PNG format)
      - Product & Category Management (full CRUD)
      - Payment Proof Upload (file handling)
      - QRIS Generation (proper QR codes)
      - WebSocket Real-time Notifications (connection established)
      - Pending Orders Counter
      - Bank Accounts Management

      ❌ **CRITICAL FAILURES - DATABASE SCHEMA MISMATCH:**
      
      **1. Authentication System (Both Staff & Customer):**
      - Users table has `role_id` column but code expects `role` column
      - Customers table missing `password` column entirely
      - All authentication endpoints returning HTTP 500 errors
      - Cannot login staff or register/login customers
      
      **2. Order Management System:**
      - Orders table missing critical columns: `table_id`, `order_type`, `customer_name`, `customer_phone`, `payment_proof`, `payment_verified`
      - Current orders table only has: id, order_number, customer_id, outlet_id, user_id, total_amount, payment_method, status, created_at
      - Cannot create takeaway or dine-in orders
      - Cannot update order status
      - Cannot retrieve orders (JOIN query fails on missing table_id)

      **ROOT CAUSE:**
      The database schema appears to be from a different/previous implementation. The backend code expects a specific schema but the actual database has a different structure. The startup database initialization is not working correctly or there's a schema version mismatch.

      **IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:**
      1. Fix database schema to match backend code expectations
      2. Ensure proper database initialization on startup
      3. Add missing columns to existing tables
      4. Test authentication flows after schema fix
      5. Test order management after schema fix

      **IMPACT:**
      - Core POS functionality (orders, authentication) is completely broken
      - Only basic CRUD operations (tables, products, categories) and utility functions work
      - System cannot handle customer registration, staff login, or order processing

      - ✅ Customer Registration: POST /api/auth/customer/register - Creates customers successfully
      - ✅ Customer Login: POST /api/auth/customer/login - Returns 200 with valid token
      
      **2. Order Management System (FIXED):**
      - ✅ Takeaway Order Creation: POST /api/orders with customer_id - Working perfectly
      - ✅ Dine-in Order Creation: POST /api/orders with table_id - Working perfectly
      - ✅ Order Listing: GET /api/orders - Returns all orders with table JOIN
      - ✅ Order Details: GET /api/orders/{id} - Returns order with items
      - ✅ Order Status Updates: PUT /api/orders/{id}/status - Complete workflow tested (pending → confirmed → cooking → ready → completed)
      
      **3. All Other Components (CONFIRMED WORKING):**
      - ✅ Table Management CRUD with QR code generation
      - ✅ Product & Category Management
